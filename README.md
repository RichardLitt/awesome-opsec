## Guides

- [A DIY Guide to Feminist Cybersecurity](https://tech.safehubcollective.org/cybersecurity/) by [Safe Hub Collective](http://safehubcollective.org/) and [Hack*Blossom](http://www.hackblossom.org/).

  This is a good guide; it goes through the most salient points of operational security, and tries to break up opsec into a few functional categories. It's goal is to limit harassment and threats online.

## Articles

- [On Cybersecurity and being targeted](http://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/on-cybersecurity-and-being-targeted). This is a good read on people targeting GitHub accounts through DNS redirects, and why you should have 2FA for everything enabled.
